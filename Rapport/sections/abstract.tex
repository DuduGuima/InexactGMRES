    In this project we will focus on combining a recently develop inexact GMRES algorithm, which differs from the classic
    GMRES algorithm in that the underlying linear system is allowed to change at each iteration, and hierarchical matrix
    approximation to a boundary integral discretisation. The main goal is to (i) understand the inner workings of GMRES
    and how changing the linear system at each iteration affects the convergence properties, and (ii) explore whether
    inexact GMRES has practical interest when combined with a variable precision -matrix compression. This project
    will be carried out in the context of two existing libraries: HMatrices.jl and Inti.jl (under development). The internship
    will take place at the POEMS laboratory, and will be supervised by Luiz M. Faria (chercheur INRIA) and Pierre
    Marchand (chercheur INRIA).
