I am deeply grateful to all those who have contributed to the successful completion of this research project during my internship at UMA and the POEMS group.

First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Farias and Mr. Marchand for providing me with this opportunity. The guidance provided during the project allowed me to work in a field that interests me very much and that I intend to pursue after my stay at ENSTA Paris. I also extend this gratitude for ENSTA Paris and UMA, who granted the funding of the project and made everything possible.

I would also like to extend my heartfelt thanks all students and staff of UMA that I have had the opportunity of meeting and/or working with. Even though I'm far away from home, the environment they created always made me feel welcomed and thankful for the support I received. A special mention goes to the students I had the pleasure of sharing a room with, and whose company helped shape this amazing experience.

Finally, I wish to thank my family and friends, both at Brazil but also the ones I got to meet here in France and are already considered as a part of my family. 

Thank you all for your invaluable contributions to this research.
